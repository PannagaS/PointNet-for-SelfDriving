# PointNet-based 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation

This project implements a custom **PointNet**-based deep learning pipeline for **semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds**, using the **SemanticKITTI** dataset as the benchmark.  
The architecture leverages both **local** and **global** point features, and extends PointNet with a **T-Net** transformation network for improved invariance to geometric transformations.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- **Problem1.py**  
  Core deep learning modules:
  - `PointLoader`: Dataset class for loading and preprocessing point clouds and labels.
  - `PointNetEncoder`: Encoder network for feature extraction.
  - `PointNetModule`: Combines local and global features for segmentation.
  - `PointNetFull`: Full model with a transformation network (T-Net).
  - `IoU`: Metric calculation (per-class IoU and mean IoU).

- **utils.py**  
  Utility functions:
  - `seed_torch()`: For reproducibility.
  - `plot_cloud()`: 3D visualization of point clouds with labels.
  - `get_remap_lut()`: Remaps SemanticKITTI labels for training.

- **semantic_kitti.yaml**  
  Contains the label mappings, color codes, and remapping tables for semantic segmentation training.

- **PointNet.ipynb**  
  Jupyter Notebook for training, validation, evaluation, and visualization of model outputs.
